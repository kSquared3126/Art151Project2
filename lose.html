    <h1>You Lose!</h1>
    <h2>You don't get a good grade on the assignment and end up failing the class. This causes you to fail out of college with your parents subsequently kicking you out and disowning you. You end up spending all of your money on gambling, as the little dopamine rushes that come from small wins are the only things that bring happiness to your miserable life. Even being uneducated, unemployed, alone, homeless, and broke; the government does not help at all, as you have been deemed a failure in terms of the Capitalist society of the US, even though it is actually a failure of the government and society as a whole; as there is both a lack of social safety nets that prevent people from arriving at such a horrible fates, 
        and the terrible stigma behind people so downtrodden, such as yourself, often causing the normal person to look at you with a blatant lack of empathy. You spend the rest of your short life living in a local park, often thought of as the weird homeless person that rummages through trash and speaks to raccoons.</h2>
